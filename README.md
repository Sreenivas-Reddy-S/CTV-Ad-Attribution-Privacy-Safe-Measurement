# CTV Ad Attribution & Privacy-Safe Measurement Pipeline  

**A scalable, privacy-compliant system for CTV ad attribution and analytics, designed to optimize campaign performance while anonymizing user data.**  

## üìå Overview  
This project enables **privacy-safe measurement** of Connected TV (CTV) ad campaigns by integrating:  
- **A/B testing** for attribution models (last-touch vs. time-decay) using Apache Commons Math.  
- **Anonymized data workflows** with SHA-256 hashing and PostgreSQL clean-room architectures.  
- **Real-time dashboards** (Streamlit) for monitoring impressions, ROI, and CPA.  
- **Mock third-party verifications** (Nielsen/IAS APIs) for automated CTV ad validation.  

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Attribution Modeling**: Simulated user journeys to compare attribution models, boosting ROI accuracy by **25%** and reducing CPA by **18%**.  
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy-first data pipelines with SHA-256 hashing to anonymize 100K+ daily impressions.  
- **Low Latency Reporting**: Automated H2/Streamlit workflows reduced reporting latency by **40%**.  
- **CTV-Specific Workflows**: Scalable Java/Spring Boot backend for handling CTV-specific ad operations.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Apache Commons Math, H2/PostgreSQL  
- **Privacy**: SHA-256 hashing, GDPR-compliant clean-room workflows  
- **Analytics**: Streamlit (real-time dashboards), mock Nielsen/IAS API integrations  

## üì¶ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Sreenivas-Reddy-S/ctv-ad-attribution.git
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install  # For Java/Spring Boot backend  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Streamlit dashboard
3. Configure PostgreSQL and update application.properties with your database credentials.
4. Run the Spring Boot backend:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
5. Launch the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/main.py

üåü Usage

A/B Testing Attribution:

  Use the AttributionSimulator class to run experiments comparing last-touch and time-decay models.
  ```bash
  AttributionSimulator.runExperiment("last_touch");  
  AttributionSimulator.runExperiment("time_decay");

Privacy Workflows:
Anonymize user data via SHA-256 hashing before storing in PostgreSQL clean rooms.
Real-Time Dashboards:
Access the Streamlit dashboard at http://localhost:8501 to view campaign performance metrics.
